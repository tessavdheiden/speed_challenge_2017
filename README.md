# Predicting speed in video

The goal is to predict the speed of a car from a video. The network consists of a CNN that uses a stack of 4 images.

## How to run
All training code is contained within `train.py`. Simply run:

```
python main.py
```

To evaluate a trained network, the network parameters have to be save in the output folder.
Then, run:

```
python eval.py --model_name my_model
```

It loads a model in output folder and uses a portion of the data in train.mp4.
